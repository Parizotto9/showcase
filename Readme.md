# Project Overview

This repository contains only the parts of the project that I personally worked on.  
The project was originally created using **React**, **TypeScript**, **TailwindCSS**, and **Vite**.

## My Contribution

I was brought in as a freelance frontend developer to work on specific parts of the project. The project was originally created by someone who is not a frontend developer and used AI to generate the initial code. As a result, the project initially contained a lot of unnecessary and disorganized code.

My tasks included:

- Working within the existing project structure and using pre-existing components.
- Creating new components where necessary to improve organization and customization.
- Organizing and cleaning up parts of the project to improve maintainability and structure.
- Identifying unused code and dependencies.

Since this was a **freelance project**, my scope was limited. I was hired to implement specific features, not to refactor the entire codebase. Even though I took the opportunity to make notes about the project and make it more structured and maintainable.

## Improvements I Made or Suggested

- Built custom components tailored to the actual needs of the project.  
- Reorganized parts of the code to improve readability and maintainability.  
- Highlighted areas where the project contained unused or redundant code.  
- Suggested how to make a cleaner structure for future development.

## Project Structure (Recommended)

For a React project, I normaly use the `/src` folder in the following way:
```
/src
├─ /assets # Images, fonts, icons, and other static files
├─ /components # Reusable UI components
├─ /helpers # Utility functions
├─ /hooks # Custom React hooks
├─ /layout # Layout components (e.g., headers, footers)
├─ /pages # Page-level components
├─ /services # API calls and business logic
├─ /stores # State management (e.g., Zustand, Redux, or context)
├─ /types # TypeScript types and interfaces
├─ app.tsx # Main App component
├─ main.tsx # Entry point
└─ index.css # Global styles
```
This structure provides a clear separation of concerns and makes the project easier to scale.  
Depending on the framework or additional tools used, some folders may vary, but the general idea remains the same.

## Final Notes

- My contribution focused on **organization, customization, and small improvements** within the scope of the freelance work.  
- The suggested structure above is how I would approach a clean React + TypeScript project in a professional environment.
- This project only includes part of the work I did on the real project, which I can’t share in its entirety.
- This project was built for desktop only (the item details page has a broken image grid), and it is also missing some API information since it only runs locally (e.g., WhatsApp group links).
